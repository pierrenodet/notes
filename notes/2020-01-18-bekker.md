## Notations

Firts, let's have some notations for the following review of the survey.

- Let $\tilde{Y} ∈ \mathcal{\tilde{Y}} = \{?,+1\}$, be the observed label
- Let $π=ℙ(Y=1)$, be the class prior on the true unobserved label
- Let $\tilde{π}=ℙ(\tilde{Y}=1)$, be the class prior on the observed label
- Let $e(x)=ℙ(\tilde{Y}=1|Y=1,X=x)$, be the propensity function
